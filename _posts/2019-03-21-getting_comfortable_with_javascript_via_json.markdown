I'm not going to lie — the transition from Ruby and Rails to JavaScript wasn't the easiest. Ruby's structure and language just made sense to me, and JS felt like a similar but very different animal for quite a while.

But once I started diving into the world of [JSON](https://simonecarletti.com/blog/2010/04/inside-ruby-on-rails-serializing-ruby-objects-with-json/) — or JavaScript Object Notation — JS immediately started to feel more familiar. Here was a handy way to serialize data that looked and behaved like a way more powerful Ruby hash, thanks to [AJAX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX).

Ruby was my introduction to object-oriented programming, and the ability to build class instances that responded to their own methods and related to each other via `belongs_to` and `has_many` made it easy to start imagining building out bigger and bigger apps with complex interrelationships.

JSON continued that education — now I could get and post complicated data structures that, with the help of [JS class constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), could then behave similarly to a Ruby class.

When I first approached my Rails with JavaScript project, I was intimidated. I had a fully functional Rails app. Now I was going to tear it apart and build it back up? The appeal of asynchronous data posting and display was a big motivator, though. As soon as I saw my data, which I had so carefully constructed to work with Rails, quickly come back when requested as JSON, I realized how versatile an app could be with a deeper and more diverse code stack to pull from.

Moving forward, I'm excited to get as comfortable with JS as I've gotten with Ruby. I know it has the power to make an app feel more fluid and user-friendly, thanks to the speed of asynchronous data operations and [JavaScript's event handlers,](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_events.asp) for example.

While Ruby and Rails had become my comfort zone, building my Rails with JavaScript project helped me see that with a methodical and open-minded approach, every new language, functionality and approach can become a valuable and easy tool among many.
