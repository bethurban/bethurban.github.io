I'm passionate about the role of responsible media and story-telling in our fast-changing world. In my career as a front page and breaking news editor for major digital media companies, I've seen first-hand how the tools available to today's journalists can either bring a story to life, communicating more clearly and deeply with users, or stymie the best efforts to reveal important developments and insights.

As I've grown professionally, I've started to look outside my journalistic career path for other fields that would be rewarding, with room for personal and intellectual growth. I've always had a sharp eye for detail, which has come in very useful as a news editor, and I love learning and applying style guides to content to help writers get across their messages while maintaining an identifiable voice. As I thought about what I could do next, web development quickly stood out as an opportunity to apply the skills and habits I've picked up as an editor to new tools and possibilities.

I've thought that when I've completed my web development studies, one promising path might be to join a development team at a media organization, where I could use my editorial expertise combined with my newly learned development skills to help build more agile tools for journalists. We'll see where web development takes me, though, as I'm certain that as I learn, I'll only imagine more and more possible outlets.

**I'm excited for my next steps, and I can't wait to learn and grow along the way.**
